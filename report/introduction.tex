The generalized eigenvalue problem
\begin{equation}
	Ax = \lambda B x,\label{eq:eig}
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ real symmetric matrices with $B$ being positive definite, arises in many
applications\cite{klinvex}. Usually $A$ and $B$ are large and sparse and we need only the smallest
few or the largest few, or the eigenvalues within an interval. In this project, we implement the trace minimization
algorithms that can be used to solve these eigenvalue problems to obtain the smallest $p$ eigenvalues and their
corresponding eigenvectors, or all the eigenpairs within a given interval $[a, b]$.

This report is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:algorithms} presents a brief deivation of the basic trace
minimization algortihm and its composite procedures, and the variations of the trace minimization algorithm, namely
trace minimization algorithm with deflation and the Davidson-type trace minimization algorithm.
Section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes the implementation details of the algorithm: the eigen decomposition
methods for dense matrices for solving the eigenvalue problem within a subspace; the iterative solvers used in
solving the reduced system, particularly the variation of conjugate gradient method used in the algorithm and its
stopping criterion; and also the multisectioning technique to subdivide an interval into subintervals for parallel
computations. Section~\ref{sec:results} shows our experimental results and discusses about the findings.
